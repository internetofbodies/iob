      <h2>Smart Home</h2>

          <h3>Your body with a smart home</h3>
          <p>
            The first is that medical data should be containable. You don't want a device to be broadcasting information that someone might eavesdrop on. 
            The second reason is that you don't want the integrity of the device to be compromised. 
            If you have a glucose monitor connected to an insulin pump, for example, you don't want the pump to release more glucose because the monitor’s data was compromised.
            The network that these devices create is called an Internet of Bodies (IoB) network, borrowing from the Internet of Things concept. IoB networks share some of the same needs as a smart home, for example. A smart home can be filled with wildly different devices—an Amazon Alexa, a smart fridge, and a system that adjusts lights automatically when people enter and exit rooms—that all use Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to communicate.
           Likewise, consumer tech and medical devices in an IoB network can both use the common medium of the body itself to send signals.
