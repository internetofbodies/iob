  <h2>Internet of Bodies Devices in Use or Development</h2>
  <img src="internetofbodies devices.png" alt="the Internet of Bodies concept" class="how">
  <p>The most recognized example of Internet of Bodies is a defibrillator or pacemaker, 
    a small device placed in the abdomen or chest to help patients with heart conditions control abnormal heart rhythms with electrical impulses. 
    In 2013, former United States Vice President Dick Cheney got his WiFi-connected defibrillator replaced with one without WiFi capacity. 
    It was feared that he could be assassinated by electric shock if a rogue agent hacked the device.

  <p>The Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine uses tiny particles called lipid nanoparticles to deliver the vaccine's genetic material
     (called messenger RNA, or mRNA) into cells in the body. These lipid nanoparticles are like tiny “bubbles” 
    made up of fats and other molecules that can surround and protect the mRNA until it reaches its destination inside the cells.

  <h2>What is Graphene Oxide?</h2>
  <p>Graphene Oxide is a tiny particle that is made up of carbon and oxygen atoms. 
    It's really small - so small that you can't see it with your eyes. But even though it's small, it can be dangerous.

    It is known to be toxic to some cells, and research has shown that it can cause inflammation and damage to the lungs when inhaled.
    
    In addition, Graphene Oxide is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, which is a protective barrier that prevents harmful substances from entering the brain. This could potentially lead to neurological problems.

        <p>
          This is the technical continuation of the fascist, transhumanist, technocratic movement, melding physical with digital.
          Each "Internet of Bodies" device is an incremental invasion of our physical selves, and each vaccine is an upgrade for
          the body to receive more nano-tech bioengineering particles, designed to slowly re-engineer humanity from the inside out.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is technology catching up with their control matrix plans, sold to the masses as something we need and want. This
          assumption—that these advancements should be meddled with in such a casually murderous way—is being criticized heavily by

          As the availability of these platforms increases past medical treatment, disparities in access to these technologies may exacerbate existing social inequalities. For example, eBCIs can be used for cognitive enhancement and cause extreme imbalances in academic or professional successes and educational advancements.
      
          “This bleak panorama brings forth an interesting dilemma about the role of policymakers in BCI commercialization,” Green said. “Should regulatory bodies intervene to prevent misuse and unequal access to neurotech? Should society follow instead the path taken by previous innovations, such as the internet or the smartphone, which originally targeted niche markets but are now commercialized on a global scale?”

            The World Economic Forum's Internet of Bodies for the Planet" discusses the concept of the "Internet of Bodies" (IoB) as promoted by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The IoB refers to an ecosystem of internet-connected devices that monitor the human body and collect personal biometric data. 
            These devices can be wearable, implanted, or ingested, and they gather data on various bodily functions and behaviors.

            Explores the potential benefits of IoB technologies, such as advancements in medical treatments, improved health monitoring, and enhanced physical performance. However, it also raises concerns about privacy, data security, and the ethical implications of such pervasive monitoring. The discussion includes the WEF's role in promoting IoB technologies and the societal impacts of integrating these devices into daily life.

            For a more detailed understanding of the IoB and its implications, you can refer to the World Economic Forum's publication on the topic.
